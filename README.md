# Blackjack 21 - RIOT OS Edition
Implementation of a simplified version of 21 written in C and programmed into a xiao-bella microcontroller.

## Overview
This project aims to showcase a simplified version of Blackjack 21 within the RIOT Operating System. With limited user input options, it has been decided that a cursor-like system was best used since we can take advantage of the microcontroller's in-built motion sensor.
